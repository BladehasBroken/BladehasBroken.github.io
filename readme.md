# Readme  

## Purpose  
The purpose of this readme is to teach people how to host and format a resume online.  
  
## Prepare  
### Install

There are something we need to install on computer before we get start to host and format our resume.  
* Find a Markdown editor and install it
* Decide where you want to host your resume (In this tutorial we will show how to host resume on github pages)
* Install a static site generater(We will use Jekyll as an example)  
  
### Knowing concepts  
At this step, everyone should have their own resume by now.  
* We should know how to use Markdown to write a file, here is a good resource to learn: [good tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
* Now we should have a github account. If you don't have one, go to [github](https://github.com/) to create one.  


## Create a local static site  
Now we have everything prepared. Let's start to build our static site.  
1. Find a folder and open a terminal
2. run this command "jekyll new [your site name]"
3. then use "cd [site name]" to change to that directory
4. run "bundle exec jekyll serve" to generate the site at first time, you only need to run "jekyll serve" after first time.
5. Then copy and paste the url to our browser, you can see our site locally.
