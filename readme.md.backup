## Instruction  
### Make Local Static Site  
1. Create a folder and open a terminal on your computer
2. Run this command "jekyll new [your site name]"
3. Use "cd [your site name]" to change to that directory
4. run "bundle exec jekyll serve" to generate the site at first time, you only need to run "jekyll serve" after first time.
5. Then copy and paste the url at Serve address to our browser, you can see our site locally.  
(Note: don't close the terminal when we run our local site)

6. Move our resume into this root folder  
7. Delete the default "index.md"  
8. Add "---  
&emsp; &ensp; &ensp;layout: home  
&emsp; &emsp; ---"  
in our resume

4. Open GitHub Desktop and clone the repository that we just created  
5. create a new brank called "gh-pages"
